I am currently a Professor with the School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, China. I received the B.S. degree (with the highest honor) in 2009 and Ph.D. degree (with the highest honor) in 2016, both from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China. I then worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher, later as an Associate Professor, and finally became a Professor with the Beijing Institute of Technology. From 2013 to 2015 and from 2018 to 2019, I was a Sponsored Researcher with the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.<br />

<br />

I was the recipient of two Excellent Ph.D. Thesis Awards from both the Chinese Institute of Electronics and the Beijing Institute of Technology in 2016. I was also the recipient of the Second-Class Prize of the National Award for Technological Invention in 2019, the First-Class Prize of the Science and Technology (Technological Invention) Award from the Chinese Institute of Electronics in 2018, the Second-Class Prize of the Ministerial Level Science and Technology Progress Award in 2014, the Young Scientist Award from the IEEE ICET 2021, and the Third-Class Prize of the National Electrical and Electronic Foundation Course Experimental Teaching Case Design Competition. <br />

<br />

I am currently a member of the Digital Signal Processing Technical Committee of the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society, a member of the Applied Signal Processing Systems Technical Committee of the IEEE Signal Processing Society, a member of the Educational Conference Programs Committee of the IEEE Signal Processing Society, a member of the Signal Processing Committee of the Chinese Institute of Electronics, and a member of the Visual Computing and Simulation Committee of the China Simulation Federation. I served as the Guest Editor of the IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing, the Financial Chair of the IEEE CAMSAP 2023 held in Costa Rica, the Financial Chair of the IEEE SiPS 2025 held in Hong Kong, the Guest Editor of the International Journal of Antennas and Propagation, and Session Chairs of many flagship conferences. I am also the regular reviewer for major journals such as IEEE TSP, IEEE WCM, IEEE TAES, IEEE TVT, IEEE SPL, IEEE COMML, Elsevier SP, Elsevier DSP, etc., and the TPC member for some international conferences in areas related to signal processing. <br />

<br />

I have more than 20 years of professional experience in system and algorithm design, implementation (through FPGA, DSP, and ARM), and debugging. I have received three Science and Technology Progress Awards and hold more than 60 patents. <br />
