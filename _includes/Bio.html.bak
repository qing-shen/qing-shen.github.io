I am currently an Associate Professor with the School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, China. I received the B.S. degree (with the highest honor) in 2009 and Ph.D. degree (with the highest honor) in 2016, both from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China. I then worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher, and later became an Associate Professor with the Beijing Institute of Technology. From 2013 to 2015 and from 2018 to 2019, I was a Sponsored Researcher with the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.<br />

<br />

I was the recipient of two Excellent Ph.D. Thesis Awards from both the Chinese Institute of Electronics and the Beijing Institute of Technology in 2016. I was also the recipient of the Second-Class Prize of the National Award for Technological Invention in 2019, the First-Class Prize of the Science and Technology (Technological Invention) Award from Chinese Institute of Electronics in 2018, the Second-Class Prize of the Ministerial Level Science and Technology Progress Award in 2014, and the Young Scientist Award of the IEEE ICET 2021. I will serve as the Financial Chair of the IEEE CAMSAP 2021 in Costa Rica (which will be postponed to 2023 due to the uncertainty generated by the pandemic). I served as the Guest Editor of the International Journal of Antennas and Propagation, the Session Chair of the IEEE ICASSP 2022 in Singapore, the Special Session Co-Organizer of the ICCAIS 2021 in Xiâ€™an, China, the Session Co-Chair of the IEEE ISCAS 2021 in Daegu, Korea, and the Workshop Co-Chair of the CSPS 2020 in Changbaishan, China. I am also the regular reviewer for major journals such as IEEE TSP, IEEE WCM, IEEE TAES, IEEE TVT, IEEE SPL, IEEE COMML, Elsevier SP, Elsevier DSP, etc., and the TPC member for some international conferences in areas related to signal processing. <br />

<br />

I have more than 14 years of professional experience in system and algorithm design, implementation (through FPGA and DSP), and debugging. I have received three Science and Technology Progress Awards and hold more than 30 patents. <br />
